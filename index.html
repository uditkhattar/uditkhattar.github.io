        <p>
          A <span id="age">20</span>-year-old rising senior at the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong> pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up in the vibrant chaos of New Delhi for 17 years before moving to the Great White North. Since
          moving to Canada for University, I've called 3 cities in Ontario home and taken trips to explore Eastern Canada
          (bonjour, Quebec!) and Western Canada (hello, Vancouver and Victoria!). It's been an adventure, to say the least!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about unlearning and relearning, constantly evolving my perspective—whether in tech or beyond.
          My goal is to create something innovative and impactful that makes a difference in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen, smashing shuttlecocks (it's <em>not</em> a birdie!) and cricket
          balls, or laughing at standup comedy—sometimes even cracking jokes myself. Who knows? My big debut might be just around
          the corner!
        </p>

          Feel free to check out my resume and connect with me via the links below—I'd love to hear from you!
