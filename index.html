      <p>
        A 20-year-old rising senior at the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong> pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science.

      <p>
        I spent the first 17 years of my life in New Delhi and have been a (for the lack of a better word) vagabond ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love un-learning and re-learning stuff. Hope to build something cool and impactful for the world to use.

        In my free time, when I'm not experimenting in the kitchen or smashing shuttlecocks (I refuse to call it a birdie)
        and cricket balls, you can find me cracking up over standup comedy-or cracking jokes myself (stay tuned for my big debut!)
